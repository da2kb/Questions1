# Questions1
1- namespace provides information about the identifiers(such as names of types,function and variables)

2- Value types are data types that stores certizn values like all numberic data such as char,decimal, double and float

3-reference value types are unlike value types don't have the main actual value but they contain a reference to the value. if the data in memory location is changed, the other varialble automatically reflects this change in value.(such as dynamic, string)

4-they are used when no more additional logic could be required in the propety and they make the propety declartion more concise.

5-the using keyword is used to include a namespace in c#

6-a variable where you can store any type of value.

7-is operator is generally used to double check whether an object is compatible with a given type.

8-generics are features in c# allows for designing a classes and methods whose types are specified only at the time of declaration and instantiation.

9-it allows a class to expose its member variables and functions to other function objects. Any public member can be accessed from outside the class.

10- yes 

11- there are a lot of ways to sort arrays including bubble sort and exchange sort and they all aim comparing each array element to another array element and swap them if they are in the wrong position.

12- they are  types to assign 'no values' or 'null values' to value types when there is no value available which was a struggle in c#

13-Distinct type that consists of a set of named constants called the enumerator list,  it is best to define an enum directly within a namespace so that all classes in the namespace can access it with equal convenience it can also be nested within a class or struct

14-Inheritance is the ability to create a class that inherits attributes and behaviors from an existing class.

15-No


16-as operator is used to perform conversion between compatible reference types or Nullable types.

17- an object is an instance of a class at any given time that is created dynamically.

18- Classes:  can support inheritance and they are reference (pointer) type so the reference can be null
Structs: Cannot support inheritance, they are  value types they cant  have a null reference 

19-The break statement terminates the loop and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop while The continue statement in C# works somewhat like the break statement. 

20-'this' is used to refer to the current instance of the class

21- try − A try block identifies a block of code for which particular exceptions is activated. It is followed by one or more catch blocks.

catch − A program catches an exception with an exception handler at the place in a program where you want to handle the problem. The catch keyword indicates the catching of an exception.

22- exception handling in c# is built upon four keywords: try, catch, finally, and throw.

23-The finally block is used to execute a given set of statements, whether an exception is thrown or not thrown. For example, if you open a file, it must be closed whether an exception is raised or not.

24-Arrays are strongly-typed collections of the same data type and have a fixed length that cannot be changed during runtime. We can access the Array elements by numeric index. The array indexes start at zero. The default value of numeric array elements is set to zero, and the reference elements are set to null.

 while An Array list is not a strongly-typed collection. It can store the values of different data types or same datatype. The size of an array list increases or decreases dynamically so it can take any size of values from any data type. ArrayList is one of the most flexible data structures from C# Collections. ArrayList contains a simple list of values. ArrayList implements the IList interface using an array and very easily we can add, insert, delete, view etc. It is very flexible because we can add without any size information that is it will grow dynamically and also shrink.

25-an object is an instance of a class at any given time that is created dynamically.

26-Constructors enable the programmer to set default values, limit instantiation, and write code that is flexible and easy to read4

27- var can only be used when a local variable is declared and initialized in the same statement; the variable cannot be initialized to null,

28-The purpose of an abstract class is to define some common behavior that can be inherited by multiple subclasses, without implementing the entire class.An abstract class cannot be inherited by structures. It can contains constructors or destructors. It can implement functions with non-Abstract methods.

29-An interface in C# contains only the declaration of the methods, properties, and events, but not the implementation.

30-A method is a code block that contains a series of statements. A program causes the statements to be executed by calling the method and specifying any required method arguments

31-A property is a member that provides a flexible tool to read and write the value of a private field.. We use them as public data members but actually, they are specific methods called accessors.

32-describes as the scope of accessibility of an Object and its members. When we specify the accessibility of a type or member we have to declare it by using any of the access modifiers 


33-Access Modifiers or Access Specifiers are used to define the visibility of a class property or method. There are times when you may not want other programs to see the properties or the methods of a class. In such cases, C# gives the ability to put modifiers on class properties and methods. The class modifiers can restrict access so that other programs cannot see the properties or methods of a class.

34-Collections provide a more flexible way to work with groups of objects. Unlike arrays, the group of objects you work with can grow and shrink dynamically as the needs of the application change. For some collections, you can assign a key to any object that you put into the collection so that you can quickly retrieve the object by using the key.

A collection is a class, so you must declare an instance of the class before you can add elements to that collection.

35-. The Hashtable class represents a collection of key-and-value pairs that are organized based on the hash code of the key,A hash table is used when you need to access elements by using key, and you can identify a useful key value.
